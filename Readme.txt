Search.ps1 has a function that lets you look for combos with specific traits via switch params. 

Then I can use https://cartoon-battle.cards/recipes to find the combos for them. 

Allskills.ps1 and the xml files were used to generate the skill maps from the XML to the in-game names. 

Some of the skills might not be mapped correctly, but a few quick tests has it working.
